# Smash and Grab Trading Strategy Analysis

## Core Strategy Framework

This strategy targets high-probability price movements in NQ (Nasdaq futures) based on key institutional price levels and time-based confluences. The approach combines multiple elements of technical analysis with a focus on specific session transitions and price bias, balanced with an evolving intuitive component.

## Key Strategic Components

### 1. Primary Price Levels

- **NY 00:00 (Midnight)**: A significant time-based level with reliable price reaction, marked with yellow/orange horizontal lines on charts
- **M5 BIAS**: Directional bias evident on 5-minute candles, especially opening candles, visualized as pink/red horizontal lines
- **VWAP**: Volume Weighted Average Price serving as dynamic support/resistance, appears as a blue curved line
- **DVWAP**: Daily VWAP used as a target level, also shown in blue
- **MA50/MA50 TSx**: 50-period Moving Average used as key support/resistance, seen on charts as a pink/red line
- **EMA9**: 9-period Exponential Moving Average, often displayed alongside MA50
- **Session High/Lows**: Asian session (AsH/AsL), London session (LoH/LoL) - clearly labeled with white horizontal lines
- **Gaps**: Price gaps between trading sessions that often get filled, clearly marked with pink horizontal lines labeled "GAP"
- **Standard Deviation Levels**: Marked with "-1", "-2", "-2.5", "-4" notation on charts, appearing as horizontal lines

- **H4 Liquidity**: Marked with white horizontal lines and specifically labeled, important target level
- **pdEQ**: Previous Day Equal level, where current day equals previous day's price
- **dOpen/dOp**: Daily open price levels serving as important reference points

### 2. Entry Methodology

- **Primary Sequence**: Clearly defined entry sequence as shown in examples:
  - **Step 1**: Position at Premium/SD level (e.g., "Premium/SD -4")
  - **Step 2**: M5 SMT confirmation
  - **Step 3**: 30s/15s CISD for precise entry timing
  - **Step 4**: "Intent thro vwap" - Decisive move through VWAP
  - **Step 5**: Movement into higher timeframe structure (H1 nFVG / NY00:00)

- **CISD Entry Identification**: Clearly marked on charts with pink/red horizontal lines labeled "CISD"
  - Multiple CISD levels often visible at key structure points
  - Entry executions often circled in yellow/orange at precise CISD intersections
  - Timeframe flexibility with both 30s and 15s CISD analysis for precision

- **Spitfire M5 Entry Model**: Specifically described as "BB / CISD" technique
  - BB appears to be a breaker block or bullish/bearish breakout pattern
  - Combined with CISD confirmation for entry trigger
  - Often accompanied by "intent" candle momentum

- **Fair Value Gap Identification**: Highlighted on charts with green rectangular boxes
  - Shows areas of price inefficiency targeted for fills
  - Often combined with CISD for entry precision

- **Direction Flexibility**: Willingness to reverse bias direction when opposing signals are strong
  - "Wasn't liking the set up for a short" despite bearish M5 BIAS
  - "SMT at AsL & NY 00:00 above made me nervous about shorting"

- **Intent Candles**: Looking for specific trigger signals
  - "30s red candle with intent followed by more and then thro CISD i was in..."
  - Clear visual identification of momentum

- **Multiple Level Confluence**: "Bounce of NY 00:00 / VWAP / MA50" shows stacking of levels for stronger signals
- **Breaker Patterns**: "Nice breaker with FVG / M1 iFVG & CISD with delivery from H1 gap"
- **Intuition Integration**: Clear evolution to intuition-based trading
  - "CISD (sort of) & intent - but intuition really" shows explicit acknowledgment

### 3. Exit Strategy

The strategy employs a "smash and grab" approach with defined targets, though this evolved over time:

- **Take Profit 1 (TP1)**: Often at Daily VWAP or session open level, clearly marked on charts with pink/red lines
  - Exact price levels labeled (e.g., "TP1 21738.75")
  - Position management visible with precise dollar profit calculation 

- **Take Profit 2 (TP2)**: Typically at NY 00:00 or M5 BIAS level, sometimes "wick in gap" as seen in examples

  - Multiple profit targets visible for scaling out positions

- **Advanced Targets**: 
  - "H4 pHi (potential 50 points / $2k to nH4 gap above = iDOL)" shows sophisticated target projection
  - "Target was pdEQ & -4 SD which was hit" showing specific SD level targets
  - H4 Liquidity targets

- **Initial No Runners Approach**: Strategy initially avoided keeping runners, focusing on quick profits
  - "Continued down again but no runners allowed"
  - "No runner as smash & grab combine pass strategy"

- **Evolution to Runners**: Later examples show implementation of runners
  - "M5 BIAS with runner to wick" showing explicit runner approach
  - "Will consider runners on XFA at lower contract size" showing transition planning
  - Consideration of "10 micros rather than 1 mini" for better runner management

- **Early Exit Discipline**: 
  - After multiple breakeven stops, ending trading for the session
  - "2 attempts at NY00:00 this morning stopped at BE twice. As you know smash & grab strat so that's me done."

- **Session-Based Exits**: "Ended session +200 bucks - made on easy mode"
- **Position Management**: Moving stops to breakeven early

### 4. Risk Management

- **Stop Loss Placement**: Initially at swing high/low beyond entry
  - "low risk entry with SL at SMT"
  - "SL at Hi" for session high entries
  - "SL at retest Wick Lo of bullish FVG" showing precise placement

- **Specific Risk Parameters**:
  - "Combine - 10 micros max & $500 hard SL" providing explicit risk limits
  - "Will be reducing risk for NY in future" showing adaptive risk management

- **Stop Loss Adjustment**: Quickly moved to breakeven after initial price movement
  - Consistent approach across multiple trades
  - "TP'd & SL BE early" showing quick risk reduction

- **Position Sizing**: 
  - Typically 2 mini/micro contracts at London/NY opens
  - Consideration of alternatives: "might will trade 10 or 20 micros instead of 1 or 2 minis even tho fees are higher..."
  - Practice account experimentation: "entered with 3 minis on practice account"

- **Instrument Selection**: Detailed comparison between MNQ vs NQ
  - "MNQ entry looks much cleaner to me"
  - "always found MNQ less gappy on 15s & 30s timeframes compared to NQ"
  - "mini has more volume then mnq, therefore it should provide the gaps that make sense"

- **Risk-Reward Assessment**: 
  - Explicit evaluation: "Was very tight trade, < 1R & max 5pts"
  - Better setups: "Entry at CISD => 1R"

- **Opportunity Selection**: 
  - "As nearly always the best one required patience i.e. trade opportunity no. 2"
  - Passing on suboptimal setups: "Would of been better waiting for next opportunity"

- **Psychological Discipline**: Recognizing when to observe rather than trade
- **Account Separation**: Using practice accounts for experimental approaches

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Optimal Execution:
1. **Preparation**: Monitor key levels before session opens
2. **Watchfulness**: Focus particularly on London and NY session opens
3. **Patience**: Wait for clear signal combination (iFVG + CISD)
4. **Precision**: Use multiple timeframes - 5-minute for context, 1-minute for entry confirmation, and 30/15-second for precise timing
5. **Discipline**: Strictly adhere to stop loss and take profit rules
6. **Adaptability**: Recognize that perfect setups are rare, look for best available confluence
7. **Confirmation Sequence**: Look for wick prints and subsequent retests for safer entries
8. **Distance Assessment**: Measure tick distance between current price and targets (less than 135 ticks ideal)
9. **Direction Assessment**: Be willing to reverse expected direction when conflicting signals appear
10. **Timeframe Flexibility**: Drop to 30/15-second timeframe when more precise entry is needed
11. **Entry Sequence**: Follow specific step sequence as outlined in Example 4
12. **Risk-Reward Evaluation**: Prioritize setups with at least 1R potential
13. **Opportunity Selection**: Practice patience to wait for better opportunities with multiple level confluence
14. **Intuition Development**: As experience grows, gradually incorporate more intuitive decision-making
15. **Session-Specific Tactics**: Adjust approach based on specific session characteristics
16. **Multiple Chart Analysis**: Consider using both TSX chart and TV chart platforms for confirmation
17. **Position Sizing Consideration**: Evaluate using 10-20 micros vs. 1-2 minis based on chart clarity and runner plans
18. **Risk Parameter Application**: Apply "10 micros max & $500 hard SL" for combines
19. **Probability Assessment**: Focus on 90% probability setups even when not perfect
20. **Intent Candle Recognition**: Learn to identify candles showing directional conviction

### Chart Setup Requirements:

### Filtering Criteria:
1. Avoid trades when VWAP stands between price and target
2. Higher probability when multiple time-based levels align
3. Stronger setups when NY 00:00 target is within 135 ticks of session open
4. Favor entries after price rejection (wick print) and retest
5. Consider ES correlation for additional confluence
6. Be cautious when SMT levels contradict expected direction
7. Watch for "intent" candles on 30/15-second timeframe as triggers
8. Prioritize setups with at least 1R potential
9. Look for multiple level confluence (NY 00:00 / VWAP / MA50)
10. When opportunities present themselves sequentially, patience often rewards with better second opportunities
11. Consider "90% probability" setups even when perfect conditions aren't present
12. Be adaptable to "sort of" patterns when intuition and price action are aligned
13. Pay attention to bank holidays and other market structure interruptions
14. Be particularly cautious with trades going against the higher timeframe flow
15. Prioritize entries at clear Fair Value Gaps with CISD confirmation
16. Favor setups where MA50 and VWAP align with directional bias

## Conclusion

The Smash and Grab trading strategy represents a sophisticated approach to NQ futures trading that leverages institutional price levels, time-based confluences, and multi-timeframe analysis. The strategy demonstrates a clear evolution from a rigid mechanical system in February to a more nuanced, intuition-integrated approach by March.

Visual analysis of the trading charts reveals a systematic and precise approach to market structure identification, with clear marking of key levels, entry points, and management decisions. The consistent chart markup style allows for quick pattern recognition and decision-making.

Key strengths include precise entry timing through CISD level identification, progressive risk management with calculated dollar risks, and adaptability to market conditions. The integration of both technical and intuitive elements allows for continued refinement and personal adaptation.

The trader's psychological development mirrors the strategy's evolution, showing growth from strict rule-following to confident intuitive decision-making while maintaining disciplined risk parameters.

The culmination of this evolution is perhaps best captured in the statement "CISD (sort of) & intent - but intuition really," which encapsulates the balance between technical structure and intuitive judgment that characterizes the mature implementation of the strategy.

For implementation, focus on the complete sequence of setup identification, confirmation, precise entry timing, and disciplined exit management. As experience grows, the balance can shift toward more intuitive pattern recognition while maintaining the core mechanical foundations.
